She’s such a nice chatty lady who takes pride about freshness of the food she serve. The Amok is the must-have here but it takes around 45-60mins for her to prepare. And the Lok lak! The special sauce she made will open up your appetite and make you crave for more! I will definitely come back and I hope to be able to meet Amey again!",

She does it all from serving you to cooking the food so be patient because the food she makes is worth waiting for! The menu is extensive as she can make whatever your heart desires. The owner is a very sweet Cambodian woman who was so kind and her food tasted like real home cooking. I am so thankful that we found this place and will return the next time I am here.
